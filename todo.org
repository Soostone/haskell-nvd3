* fix Series - values field should, in json, be an array of objects with x and y fields - at least in line chart
** may need to have different Value types for Int and Float and different Series objects for different charts
*** write a function changeKeys that takes an object and changes the keys -- foldl1' with intersection again
* find out why filterEmpty is not working for the Series object through interactive debugging
* buildAxisOptions
* look at all examples at the NVD3 website and make sure the library can generate all of them
* write convenience functions to build HTML around the generated javascript
